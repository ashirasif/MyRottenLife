# MyRottenLife

A React Native app that I made to document my (rotten) life. An app made for writing on a daily basis. It saves every file with date and time stamp so, it gets easier to locate the journal afterwards.

# What's left:
I want to use LSB steganography with the text files, to make em' more secure. That's the goal for now at least.
